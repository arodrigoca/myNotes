putting stock HC-05 in AT mode:

Upload this code to an uno. Then, power the module holding the button (key pin). LED should flash every 2 seconds.

#include <SoftwareSerial.h>

SoftwareSerial mySerial(10, 11); // RX, TX

void setup() {

Serial.begin(9600);

pinMode(9,OUTPUT); digitalWrite(9,HIGH);

Serial.println("Enter AT commands:");

mySerial.begin(38400);

}

void loop()

{

if (mySerial.available())

Serial.write(mySerial.read());

if (Serial.available())

mySerial.write(Serial.read());

}

Just send AT commands.

use FTDI serial converter, connect everything and then open coolterm. Put baud rate at 9600. Terminal configured to CR&LF and then
use the line mode in coolterm to send strings. Should work.
